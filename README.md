Improved the Barr Coding Standards function for “&” used as an address modifier instead of an AND operator, and added the number of errors detected.

New in Cweed4 V4.04 2022 Jan 14
Changes to Cweed4_script.f to improve the Barr 3.1 coding rules.
Used BigReplace to allow long strings to be processed.
Changed “Show Info” menu button to “Refresh”.

Changes to Cweed4_script.f to improve the Barr 3.1 coding rules.
Added ctrlQ to show and fix lowercase characters after a '// ' comment
Increased Barr Coding Standard buffer size to $400 to allow longer lines to be processed.

New in Cweed4 V4.02
The file Cweed4_script.f is now loaded when running the Barr 3.1 function. 
This allows the rules to be changed and reloaded without re-compiling Cweed.
If the file Cweed4_script.f is not found in the directory where Cweed4 is running, the default file is used
i.e. the one that existed when Cweed4 was compiled.

New in Cweed4 V4.01 
New name – Cweed4 . Searching for “Cweed” online finds lots of sites about “weed” – “Cweed4” is easier to find. The version has also been reset to Cweed4 V4.01.
Added a custom file Cweed4.script for the Barr Coding Standard (2018) – this allows modifications to be made without recompiling Cweed4.

New in V4.25
Press F2 to apply the Barr Coding Standard (2018) Rules 3.1 Spaces a, g, h, i and j.
Added source files fo Win32Forth, so that system words can be viewed.

New in V4.24 
Now packaged with Win32Forth6v05H 2019 Mar 02 which fixes a bug that forced its window to be too small.

New in V4.23 
Indenting now ignores #ifdef, #ifndef, #else and #endif if the line contains double underscores : __IGNORE_THISE_INDENT__
This is to prevent indentation in *.h files with the usual redefinition macro format, below.
Please make sure any #else and #endif has a double underscore in a comment on the same line :

#ifndef __HEADER_FILE_NAME__
#define __HEADER_FILE_NAME__

 ... your code here...

#endif // __HEADER_FILE_NAME__

New in V4.2
 “Select File” now defaults to All Files *.*,made INDENT_SPACES changeable.

New in V4.1 :
 NumName.f Howerd Oakford V1.0 2012 Feb 28  Win32Forth version  www.inventio.co.uk
 Display a 15 bit number (from 0 to 32767) as an English word, and two 15 bit numbers as a pair of words.
 The two-word phrase calculated from the checksum or hash of two different files has a roughly 1 in a billion chance of being the same
 This allows two files in different locations and/or times to be compared by human beings...
 This code requires the file NumName.txt in the same folder

Changes to Cweed4_script.f to improve the Barr 3.1 coding rules.
Previous versions of Cweed4 V4.02 could be used if you simply update the Cweed4_script.f file, but this causes an “interesting” version control effect :
Cweed4.exe is compiled with the version of Cweed4_script.f that exists at the time that it is created. If this is different to the Cweed4_script that exists when Cweed4.exe is run you can get a different behaviour if you delete Cweed4_script.f (because it would use the pre-compiled words from an earlier Cweed4_script.f file).
Not sure how to handle this yet… Maybe compare a hash of the built in script to the script file, and issue a warning if they are different… Watch this space :-)
